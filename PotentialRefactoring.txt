Other Potential Refactoring for the Maze Game:
- Handle collision on Actors rather than Game State
- Invistigate and fixing flickering
- Remove, _getch in Process Input
- Handle Player movement on the Player instead of GameplayState
- Maybe handle Draw in a separate thread
- Why is GameplayState::Enter only calling Load? If that is all it is ever going to do, maybe make it one function
